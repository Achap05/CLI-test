# Introduction github CLI

GitHub CLI is a command-line tool that brings pull requests, issues, GitHub Actions, and other GitHub features to your terminal, so you can do all your work in one place.

GitHub CLI is an open source tool for using GitHub from your computer's command line. When you're working from the command line, you can use the GitHub CLI to save time and avoid switching context. It includes features such as:

    View, create, clone, and fork repositories
    Create, close, edit, and view issues and pull requests
    Review, diff, and merge pull requests
    Run, view, and list workflows
    Create, list, view, and delete releases
    Create, edit, list, view, and delete gists
    List, create, delete.
    
What's the difference between GitHub CLI and Git on the command line?

The Git command line interface (git) allows you to work with a local or remote Git repository. The remote repository may be hosted on GitHub or it may be hosted by another service.

GitHub CLI (gh) is specifically designed to work with GitHub. It allows the use of the command line to interact with GitHub in many ways.
